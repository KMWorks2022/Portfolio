My Salesforce Trailhead Profile link below is where you can view what all I have learned in Salesforce. All hands-on projects and quizzes I completed were checked by Salesforce and badge was only earned if I completed all the steps successfuly in my test enviorments.  
Some of the badges I earned were in Salesforce processes, navigation, data management, cloud architecture, exporting, importing data, user access, project management,   Tableau reporting, Administrator tasks, and Lighting App builder to just name a few.
